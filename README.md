Simple application to learn about back-end development using Akka HTTP.
This application is analogous to an entry ticket to cloud development:

Many things could be learn after:
  1. CI/CD pipelines.
  2. Docker and orchestration tools (Kubernetes, Swarm, Mesos, Amazon ECS, Azure, etc..)
  3. Cluster application (Akka Cluster)
  4. Microservices,
  5. Event Sourcing, etc
  etc! the possibilities are endless!
